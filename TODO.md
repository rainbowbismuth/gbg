# Build

* Structure for generating multiple ROMs
* Include testing framework
* Re-arrange files like `projects/instrument/src` & `common/src`?
* Should allow for having a `test` dir per project? idk

# Code

* Shuffle out some sort of minimal initialization routines
* Same with hardware definition files
* Small test harness code (see `notes/testing.md`)
* Start code for instrument in it's own location
