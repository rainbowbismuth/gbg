# What?

I thought it might be fun to slowly working on at least getting some of the
graphics from Celeste working on the CGB, especially since I've been doing all
DMG stuff so far.

The Pico-8 has a 128x128 sprite sheet of 8x8 tiles. There's a 16 color palette
but a lot of the tiles seem to be limited to 4 colors. Some, like the strawberries
or Madeline use more. In both cases I think these could be done with some
special handling & overlapping sprites.

It looks like you can write to palette data during vblank & hblank?
